            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm Grace Ndumi and I love creating things with code. I started learning programming actually two weeks ago in the Directed Bootcamp and got hooked on the process of building cool stuff from scratch.Another thing that I love doing is dancing and watching mostly anime especially one piece.Yeah that is all that I can say about myself.One of my hobbies including listening to some podcasts especially the Jumpers Jump podcast because I really love ghost stories and  conspiracy theories. </p>
            <h3>Education</h3>
            <p>I studied at Alliance Girl's High school and I am truly grateful because it gave me this opportunity to take part in this bootcamp which will open great opportunities for me if I manage to work hard and especially smart in studying. </p>
            <h4>Why programming?</h4>
            <p>I'm passionate about technology and thrive on the continuous learning opportunities it provides. The field of programming is always evolving, and I'm excited to stay at the forefront of innovation by constantly learning and improving my skills and I also think it's cool and awesome being able to code and do programming.</p>
